# CubbiCraft
[W.I.P] CubbiVT's official modpack. Made by the community, for the cummunity.


This modpack is a Work In Progress, you can see updates to the modpack, adding new or removing mods. As of now, the mods used are what I think needs to be added. In the future, the modpack will be made by my community. As of right now, I'm not streaming, and don't have a community.

For the community: if you want a mod to be added or removed (same for resource packs or shaders), and if it's worth it, I will add it.

If there is any issues to the modpack, please repport to the GitHub's official page and make an issue. I will see the issue and fix it.

## 🔗 How to Download?

To downlaod the modpack, please head to the [Modrinth's modpack page](https://modrinth.com/modpack/cubbicraft). It is **recommended** to use the Modrinth launcher for ease-of-use.

Thank you for testing and making it possible. And thanks for the support.
